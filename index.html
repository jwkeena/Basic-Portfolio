        <p>I am a front-end web developer, philosopher, and Classicist based in Manchester, New Hampshire. 
            My languages of choice are JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Latin, and Ancient Greek. I have
            years of experience teaching undergraduates, studying the humanities, writing and 
            editing papers, and, more recently, coding web applications. I have an eye for detail, 
            a mind for complex ideas and languages, a passion for online interactivity, 
            and an interest in making precise, syntactical, logical sense. 
        </p>

        <p>I am currently enrolled at the University of New Hampshire's <a id="text-link3" href=" https://codingbootcamp.unh.edu/" target="_blank"
            >Full Stack Web Development</a> program, learning a range of technologies including Git, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js,
            React.js, MongoDB, and MySQL. My previous academic training includes a Master of Studies 
            in Ancient Philosophy from the University of Oxford, a Master of Arts in English, 
            and a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy and Classics. If you want a developer who 
            understands the importance not only of SEO, UX/UI design, and programming syntax, 
            but also the grammar of human languages, the logic of critical thinking, 
            and the rhetoric of online content, I'm your best choice.
        </p>

        <p> When I'm not coding and learning new technologies at UNH, you can find me teaching 
            Ancient Greek Philosophy at <a id = "text-link1" href="https://www.nashuacc.edu/academics/honors-program" target="_blank">
            Nashua Community College</a>, or at home playing yet another round of the mesmerizing and beautiful 
            <a id = "text-link2" href = "#" onclick="changeBackground">Tetris Effect</a>...when my family lets me.
