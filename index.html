        <p>I am a front-end web developer, philosopher, and Classicist based in Manchester, New Hampshire. 
            My languages of choice are JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Latin, and Ancient Greek. I have
            years of experience teaching undergraduates, studying the humanities, writing and 
            editing papers, and, more recently, coding web applications. I have an eye for detail, 
            a mind for complex ideas and languages, a passion for online interactivity, 
            and an interest in making precise, syntactical, logical sense. 
        </p>

        <p>I am currently enrolled at the University of New Hampshire's Full Stack Web Development
            program, learning a range of technologies including Git, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js,
            React.js, MongoDB, and MySQL. My previous academic training includes a Master of Studies 
            in Ancient Philosophy from the University of Oxford, a Master of Arts in English, 
            and a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy and Classics. If you want a developer who 
            understands the importance not only of SEO, UX/UI design, and programming syntax, 
            but also the grammar of human languages, the logic of critical thinking, 
            and the rhetoric of online content, I'm your best choice.
        </p>

        <p> When I'm not coding and learning new technologies at UNH, you can find me sharing my 
            academic work on Academia.edu, teaching Ancient Greek Philosophy at Nashua Community 
            College, or at home playing yet another round of the mesmerizing and beautiful Tetris Effect.
